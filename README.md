# Typesense Ruby Library [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/typesense.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/typesense) 


Ruby client library for accessing the [Typesense HTTP API](https://github.com/typesense/typesense).

Follows the API spec [here](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-api-spec).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'typesense'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install typesense

## Usage

You'll find detailed documentation here: [https://typesense.org/api/](https://typesense.org/api/)

Here are some examples with inline comments that walk you through how to use the Ruby client: [examples](examples)

Tests are also a good place to know how the the library works internally: [spec](spec)

### Keep-alive connections

By default, the client opens a fresh HTTP connection (and TLS handshake) for every request. For high-traffic applications this can dominate request latency. Setting `keep_alive_connections: true` enables persistent connections via the `:net_http_persistent` Faraday adapter:

```ruby
Typesense::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV['TYPESENSE_API_KEY'],
  nodes: [{ host: 'localhost', port: 8108, protocol: 'https' }],
  connection_timeout_seconds: 3,
  num_retries: 1,
  keep_alive_connections: true
)
```

Notes:

- Connections are cached per `(thread, node)`. `Net::HTTP` is not thread-safe, so each thread maintains its own keep-alive socket to each Typesense node, and the existing node round-robin still works.
- A cached connection is dropped automatically when a network error occurs, so retries open a fresh socket. We recommend setting `num_retries` to at least `1` so the gem can recover from a server- or load-balancer-side idle timeout transparently.
- Idle sockets are closed after 30 seconds; tune your load balancer's idle timeout to match or exceed this.
- The option defaults to `false`, so upgrading the gem does not change behaviour until you opt in.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 

### Releasing

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
